OpenVPN4UCS provides an integration of OpenVPN into the 
Univention Corporate Server. It allows any Univention Server
to be configured as an OpenVPN server using the normal UCS
web-based configuration.
</p>

<p>
In order to allow users to use the VPN, the VPN option has to be activated
within the user object. Once this is done a so-called 'ready2go package'
will be created and made available via web and user's home directory.
This package contains:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
certificates for use with OpenVPN
</li>
<li>
configuration file to be passed to OpenVPN on the client.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Authentication is done as two-factor authentication, checking the certificate
as well as username/password of the user.
