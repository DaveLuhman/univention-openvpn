Introduction of a license model in version 1.0:
<p>
Starting with version 1.0 there will be a license mechanism. The basic
functionalities (all released so far) will remain free of charge for up
to five users. New features like the connection overview, downloadable
ready2go packages und IPv6 support are free of charge as well. For
site-to-site connectivity as well as more than five vpn users there
a license fee has to be paid.
</p>

<p>
What does this mean for operators, which already have more than five 
vpn users?
</p>

<p>
There will be no restrictions to configurations already in place. 
Granted access will still be functional, issued certificates still be 
valid. But as soon as you add a new vpn user or change the 
configuration of the vpn server the OpenVPN4UCS license will be 
checked. If there is no valid, an outdated or an insufficient license 
found, the desired changes will not be made and a further management of 
the vpn will not be possible via the Univention Management Console 
until a valid license is registered. But even in this case no already 
granted access will be revoked, the configuration to this point remains.
