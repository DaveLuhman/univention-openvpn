<h3>Version 1.1.11</h3
<p>
OpenVPN has finally removed one configuration option with the current
version 2.4 of the official OpenVPN client software, which results in
incompatibility with older configuration files. Due to this reason
OpenVPN4UCS now generates configuration files compatible to version 2.4.
These kann be used with client version 2.3 as well, but not with any
older version. For usage with older versions (version < 2.3) a separate
configuration file is generated as well, which can be recognized by the
files name ending *-pre23.ovpn.
</p>

<h3>Version 1.1.10</h3
<p>
<strong>Warning</strong>: this update contains an <strong>incompatible</strong> change that immediately
prevents any connections using the previous client configs.
</p>

<p>
OpenVPN's default cipher is subject to the <a href="https://sweet32.info">Sweet32 attack</a>.
As a result this update now enforces AES-256-CBC which is not affected.
</p>

<p>
All ready2go bundles will be recreated with an updated config, since this cipher change
has to be mirrored by the client configs.
</p>

<p>
Sitetosite mode is afflicted by this change, too, so you have to update the
corresponding configs at connected sites accordingly.
</p>

<p>
In both cases the modification consists of adding a line
<pre>
cipher AES-256-CBC
</pre>
to the config, or replace any already existing line accordingly.
