<h3>Version 1.1.11</h3
<p>
OpenVPN 2.4 removed an option used in the client configs, so they don't work
anymore. Therefore this version creates OpenVPN 2.4 compatible client configs.
Unfortunately they are not compatible to versions < 2.3, so the configs previously
created are included, too. They are named *-pre23.ovpn.
</p>

<h3>Version 1.1.10</h3
<p>
<strong>Warning</strong>: this update contains an <strong>incompatible</strong> change that immediately
prevents any connections using the previous client configs.
</p>

<p>
OpenVPN's default cipher is subject to the <a href="https://sweet32.info">Sweet32 attack</a>.
As a result this update now enforces AES-256-CBC which is not affected.
</p>

<p>
All ready2go bundles will be recreated with an updated config, since this cipher change
has to be mirrored by the client configs.
</p>

<p>
Sitetosite mode is afflicted by this change, too, so you have to update the
corresponding configs at connected sites accordingly.
</p>

<p>
In both cases the modification consists of adding a line
<pre>
cipher AES-256-CBC
</pre>
to the config, or replace any already existing line accordingly.
</p>
