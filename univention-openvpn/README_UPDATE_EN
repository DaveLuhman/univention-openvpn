<p>
WARNING: this update contains an INCOMPATIBLE change that immediately
prevents any connections using the previous client configs.
</p>

<p>
OpenVPN's default cipher is subject to the <a href="https://sweet32.info">Sweet32 attack</a>.
As a result this update now enforces AES-256-CBC which is not affected.
</p>

<p>
All readytogo bundles will be recreated with an updated config, since this cipher change
has to be mirrored by the client configs.
</p>

<p>
Sitetosite mode is afflicted by this change, too, so you have to update the
corresponding configs at connected sites accordingly.
</p>

<p>
In both cases the modification consists of adding a line
<pre>
cipher AES-256-CBC
</pre>
to the config, or replace any already existing line accordingly.
